/*It would be perfectly reasonable for the Time2 class of Fig. 8.5 to represent the time internally as the number of
seconds since midnight rather than the three integer values hour, minute and second.
Clients could use the same public methods and get the same results.
Modify the Time2 class of Fig. 8.5 to implement the Time2 as the number of seconds since midnight and show that no
change is visible to the clients of the class.
